    <h1 class="display-4">Hey, I'm Shailendra Singh.</h1>
    <h6>Software Developer and Student</h6>
    <p>Hello, I am a software developer absolutely fascinated about everything software and making otherwise dumb machines like computers do
    intelligent tasks. I have been programming for over 9 years and through that time I have gained experience with everything from Windows 
    application development to web development and bots. I have made many <a href=@projectsLink>pieces of software</a> not only for fun but, to also solve serious problems
    my peers and I face.</p>
    <p>While I am most experienced with C# and the .NET tech stack, I know many other <a href=@technologiesLink>technologies and languages</a>. 
    I'm also a natural learner so, I will never have any problems developing software for any language or tech stack asked of me. In fact, I am 
    currently learning C++ and x86 assembly language on my free time both for fun and so I can have some new tools on my tool belt when writing 
    code.</p>
